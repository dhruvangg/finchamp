                            <h5>Direct Tax</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The definition of direct tax is hidden in its name which implies that this tax is paid directly to the government by the taxpayer</li>
                                <li>The general examples of this type of tax in India are <a href="https://groww.in/p/income-tax/">Income Tax</a> and Wealth Tax.</li>
                                <li>From the governmentâ€™s perspective, estimating tax earnings from direct taxes is relatively easy as it bears a direct correlation to the income or wealth of the registered taxpayers.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h5>Indirect Tax</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Indirect taxes are slightly different from direct taxes and the collection method is also a bit different. These taxes are consumption-based that are applied to goods or services when they are bought and sold.</li>
                                <li>The indirect tax payment is received by the government from the seller of goods/services.</li>
                                <li>The seller, in turn, passes the tax on to the end-user i.e. buyer of the good/service.</li>
                                <li>Thus the name indirect tax as the end-user of the good/service does not pay the tax directly to the government.</li>
                                <li>Some general examples of indirect tax include sales tax, Goods and Services Tax (<a href="https://groww.in/p/gst/">GST</a>), Value Added Tax (VAT), etc.</li>
